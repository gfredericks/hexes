Spec for encoding binary data in human-language words. The main idea is
to create sets of 256 memorable words to make binary data easier for
humans to handle.

## What is this serious?

1. Versioning? Maybe?
2. Some kind of tag indicating an incantation?
   - `data:mime/type;hexes,foo-bar-bazzes` is terrible, right?
